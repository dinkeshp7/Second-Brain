Declaration file to put types and use express originally written in js to be used in ts with its help.

if i add // @ts-ignore above any line giving error , it will remove the error 

express is written in js , how to use it in ts -> we can use declaration file

dev depency vs production dependency

you are extending the built-in Express Request type in TypeScript to include a custom property-in this case, userId.
declare global {
  namespace Express {
    interface Request {
      userId?: string;
    }
  }
}
Express’s Request type by default does NOT include custom properties like userId. If you try to assign req.userId = ... in your 
middleware or route handler, TypeScript will throw an error because it doesn’t recognize userId as a valid property on Request.
By extending the Request interface, you tell TypeScript that userId is a valid property, so you can safely read/write it anywhere in 
your codebase without type errors
